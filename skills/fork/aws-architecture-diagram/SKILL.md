# AWS Architecture Diagram Skill

Generate AWS architecture diagrams as native `.drawio` files using official AWS Architecture Icons. Optionally export to PNG, SVG, or PDF with embedded XML (so exported files remain editable in draw.io).

## How to create a diagram

1. **Generate draw.io XML** in mxGraphModel format following the rules below
2. **Write the XML** to a `.drawio` file using the Write tool
3. **If the user requested an export format** (png, svg, pdf), export using the draw.io CLI (see Export section)
4. **Open the result** with `open` (macOS), `xdg-open` (Linux), or print the path

## Layout Rules

- **Left-to-right flow** for data/request path
- **UI/Frontend on the LEFT** (users access from left side)
- **Data sources / external systems on the RIGHT**
- Use horizontal lanes for parallel paths (top lane, bottom lane)
- **Minimum 220px horizontal spacing** between icons (room for edge labels)
- **Minimum 250px vertical spacing** between lanes
- Secondary/auxiliary services (monitoring, DLQ) go BELOW main flow with 280px+ gap
- Canvas: `pageWidth="2400" pageHeight="1400"`, viewport `dx="2800" dy="1600"`
- Always include a title block after the background rectangle:
```xml
<mxCell value="&lt;b&gt;Diagram Title&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author | Date | Version" style="text;html=1;align=left;verticalAlign=top;whiteSpace=wrap;rounded=0;fontSize=14;spacing=8;" vertex="1" parent="1">
  <mxGeometry x="40" y="30" width="420" height="60" as="geometry" />
</mxCell>
```

## Icon Style

- Icons are from draw.io's built-in `mxgraph.aws4` stencil library — the **official AWS Architecture Icons** (https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/)
- Icon size: **78x78px** for main services, **65x65px** for secondary
- Use `sketch=0` on all icons
- Use `strokeColor=#ffffff` on all AWS service icons
- Font size: **12px** for labels
- **NO colored backgrounds** on group boxes — always `fillColor=none`

### 3D / Isometric Diagrams — use a different icon library
If the user asks for a **3D**, **isometric**, or "AWS 3D" diagram, do NOT fake it by placing flat `aws4` icons on hand-built platform/pedestal shapes. draw.io has a real, separate built-in library for this: `mxgraph.aws3d.*`.
- Load `references/aws-icons-3d.md` before picking any icon — it has the verified shape table, style prefix, sizes, and the native `isometricEdgeStyle` edge templates.
- This library is a legacy pre-2019 icon set with **much smaller coverage** than `aws4` (no API Gateway, ECS/EKS/Fargate, Step Functions, EventBridge, SNS, Aurora, CloudWatch, IAM, etc.). Check the gap table in that reference file before assuming an icon exists, and flag substitutions to the user rather than guessing a stencil name.
- For generic hardware (clients, on-prem servers, racks, switches) with no AWS-specific icon, see `references/aws-icons-allied-telesis.md` — a separate bundled isometric image library that fills that gap.
- These icons are already 3D on their own — arrange them in an ascending isometric staircase (diagonal offsets between nodes), don't add fake platforms underneath.
- Use `edgeStyle=isometricEdgeStyle` (with `endArrow=block` override for reliable arrowheads) instead of `orthogonalEdgeStyle` for connectors.


## Edge Style — CRITICAL FOR CLEAN DIAGRAMS

**Base edge style:**
```
edgeStyle=orthogonalEdgeStyle;rounded=1;orthogonalLoop=1;jettySize=auto;html=1;strokeWidth=2;exitX=1;exitY=0.5;exitDx=0;exitDy=0;entryX=0;entryY=0.5;entryDx=0;entryDy=0;
```

**Edge label rules:**
- Keep labels SHORT (1-2 words max). Detail goes in icon labels, not edge labels.
- Always add `labelBackgroundColor=#F5F5F5;fontSize=11;` to edges with labels
- For edges WITHOUT labels: omit `value` entirely
- When NOT to label: if the flow is obvious (Lambda → DynamoDB doesn't need "Write")

**For edges to services ABOVE or BELOW main flow, use explicit exit/entry points:**
- Exit bottom: `exitX=0.5;exitY=1;exitDx=0;exitDy=0;`
- Enter top: `entryX=0.5;entryY=0;entryDx=0;entryDy=0;`
- This prevents draw.io from routing lines through other icons

**Edge types:**
- Solid (`strokeWidth=2`): primary data flow
- Dashed (`strokeWidth=2;dashed=1;`): optional/async
- Red dashed (`strokeWidth=2;dashed=1;strokeColor=#DD344C;`): error path

**Edge attachment (CRITICAL — fixes "green cross" problem):**
- Every edge MUST have both `source="<cell-id>"` and `target="<cell-id>"` attributes referencing valid cell IDs
- NEVER create floating/unattached edges — all edges must be bound to shapes at both ends
- Always include `exitX/exitY` and `entryX/entryY` to define exact connection points on the shape perimeter
- **Cross-container edges:** When source and target are in different containers, set the edge's `parent="1"`

## Visual Quality: straight arrows, no overlaps, professional layout

A diagram with correct icons but a messy layout still reads as unprofessional. Check every diagram against these rules before finishing — they're deliberately concrete/checkable, not vague "make it look nice" advice:

- **Align nodes to a consistent axis so edges are single, straight segments.** Keep the horizontal or vertical delta between adjacent nodes in a flow constant (same lane y-coordinate, same column spacing) so connecting edges render as one clean line instead of a dogleg.
- **Align branch/secondary nodes on the exact same centerline as their parent.** If a node branches off vertically (e.g. an auxiliary service below the main flow), its horizontal center must match its parent's horizontal center exactly — compute `child.x = parent.center_x - child.width/2`, don't eyeball it. A few pixels of misalignment turns a "straight down" edge into a visibly crooked diagonal.
- **One bend maximum per edge, ideally zero.** If a computed edge path would need more than one bend to avoid an obstacle, the layout is wrong — move the node, don't add more bends to route around the problem.
- **No edge may cross through an unrelated icon's bounding box.** Before finalizing coordinates, check each edge's path against every icon's `(x, y, width, height)` rectangle it isn't connected to. If it would cross one, move the node or add an explicit exit/entry point to route around it.
- **No two edges may run on top of each other or visually merge.** If two edges would travel the same corridor (e.g. two parallel flows between the same pair of lanes), offset them — different exit/entry points, or an explicit waypoint — so there's a visible gap between them.
- **Minimize edge crossings overall.** Order nodes in the direction the data actually flows so edges rarely need to cross each other. If a crossing is unavoidable (e.g. a feedback/response path), route it with a visible offset rather than letting it overlap another edge.
- **Keep spacing consistent, not just "enough."** Use the same minimum step size between every pair of adjacent nodes in a flow — a diagram where some gaps are 400px and others are 250px reads as sloppy even if nothing technically overlaps.
- **Balance the composition on the canvas.** Don't leave one half of the page dense and the other empty; size the canvas to the actual content plus a consistent margin.
- **Self-check before finishing:** after placing every coordinate, mentally trace each edge from source to target and verify (1) it doesn't cross any icon, (2) it doesn't overlap another edge, (3) it has at most one bend, (4) its endpoints are flush with the icons it connects. Fix the layout, not just the intent, if any check fails.

## PNG Export Background
First element after root cells (lowest z-order):
```xml
<mxCell value="" style="rounded=0;whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;fillColor=#F5F5F5;strokeColor=none;" vertex="1" parent="1">
  <mxGeometry x="0" y="0" width="2400" height="1400" as="geometry" />
</mxCell>
```

## AWS Icon Patterns (VERIFIED WORKING)

### resourceIcon (78x78, colored square frame)

| Service | resIcon | fillColor |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Lambda | `mxgraph.aws4.lambda` | `#ED7100` |
| API Gateway | `mxgraph.aws4.api_gateway` | `#E7157B` |
| EventBridge | `mxgraph.aws4.eventbridge` | `#E7157B` |
| SNS | `mxgraph.aws4.sns` | `#E7157B` |
| SES | `mxgraph.aws4.simple_email_service` | `#DD344C` |
| Step Functions | `mxgraph.aws4.step_functions` | `#E7157B` |
| DynamoDB | `mxgraph.aws4.dynamodb` | `#C925D1` |
| RDS | `mxgraph.aws4.rds` | `#C925D1` |
| S3 | `mxgraph.aws4.s3` | `#7AA116` |
| CloudFront | `mxgraph.aws4.cloudfront` | `#8C4FFF` |
| Route 53 | `mxgraph.aws4.route_53` | `#8C4FFF` |
| ECS | `mxgraph.aws4.ecs` | `#ED7100` |
| EC2 | `mxgraph.aws4.ec2` | `#ED7100` |

Style template:
```
sketch=0;points=[[0,0,0],[0.25,0,0],[0.5,0,0],[0.75,0,0],[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0.25,1,0],[0.5,1,0],[0.75,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0.25,0],[0,0.5,0],[0,0.75,0],[1,0.25,0],[1,0.5,0],[1,0.75,0]];outlineConnect=0;fontColor=#232F3E;fillColor=<COLOR>;strokeColor=#ffffff;dashed=0;verticalLabelPosition=bottom;verticalAlign=top;align=center;html=1;fontSize=12;fontStyle=0;aspect=fixed;shape=mxgraph.aws4.resourceIcon;resIcon=mxgraph.aws4.<SERVICE>
```

### productIcon (70x100, taller with service header bar)

| Service | prIcon |
|---------|--------|
| SQS | `mxgraph.aws4.sqs` |

Style template:
```
sketch=0;outlineConnect=0;fontColor=#232F3E;gradientColor=none;strokeColor=#ffffff;fillColor=#232F3E;dashed=0;verticalLabelPosition=bottom;verticalAlign=top;align=center;html=1;whiteSpace=wrap;fontSize=12;fontStyle=0;shape=mxgraph.aws4.productIcon;prIcon=mxgraph.aws4.<SERVICE>
```

### Standalone shapes (no resIcon needed)

| Shape | shape value | fillColor |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Client/Browser | `mxgraph.aws4.client` | `#232F3D` |
| Traditional Server | `mxgraph.aws4.traditional_server` | `#232F3D` |
| Firewall | `mxgraph.aws4.generic_firewall` | `#232F3D` |
| ALB | `mxgraph.aws4.application_load_balancer` | `#8C4FFF` |
| NLB | `mxgraph.aws4.network_load_balancer` | `#8C4FFF` |
| VPC Endpoint | `mxgraph.aws4.endpoints` | `#8C4FFF` |

### Group boundaries

| Group | grIcon | strokeColor |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| AWS Cloud | `mxgraph.aws4.group_aws_cloud_alt` | `#232F3E` |
| Account | `mxgraph.aws4.group_account` | `#CD2264` |
| On-premise | `mxgraph.aws4.group_on_premise` | `#5A6C86` |
| Corporate DC | `mxgraph.aws4.group_corporate_data_center` | `#388E3C` |
| VPC | `mxgraph.aws4.group_vpc2` | `#8C4FFF` |
| Subnet (public) | `mxgraph.aws4.group_security_group` | `#7AA116` |
| Subnet (private) | `mxgraph.aws4.group_security_group` | `#147EBA` |

**Container nesting (CRITICAL for grouping):**
- ALL group/boundary shapes MUST include `container=1;dropTarget=1;` in their style
- Child cells inside a boundary MUST set `parent="<boundary-cell-id>"` instead of `parent="1"`
- This ensures moving a boundary moves all its children together
- Child geometry coordinates are **relative to the parent container**, not the canvas
- **Cross-container edges:** When source and target are in different containers, set the edge's `parent="1"`

## BROKEN Icons — DO NOT USE

- `resIcon=mxgraph.aws4.dynamodb_table` — renders as empty colored square
- `resIcon=mxgraph.aws4.dynamodb_stream` — renders as empty colored square
- `resIcon=mxgraph.aws4.general_saml_token` — renders as black square
- `resIcon=mxgraph.aws4.endpoint` — may not render
- `resIcon=mxgraph.aws4.kinesis_data_streams` — unreliable

**Alternatives:**
- DynamoDB tables/streams → use `resIcon=mxgraph.aws4.dynamodb` with descriptive labels
- External systems → use `shape=mxgraph.aws4.traditional_server`
- Browsers/clients → use `shape=mxgraph.aws4.client`

## Audience Mode

Before generating, assess the target audience:
- **Technical**: Use service names, protocol labels (HTTPS, gRPC), CIDR blocks, instance types
- **Non-technical**: Use action labels ("Store Data", "Send Notification"), hide implementation details, use numbered flow (① ② ③)

If unclear, ask: "Technical audience or executive/non-technical?"

### Numbered flow edges (for non-technical mode)
Instead of technical labels, show flow order with circled numbers:
- Flow A: ① → ② → ③ → ④ (white circled numbers)
- Flow B: ❶ → ❷ → ❸ → ❹ (black circled numbers for second flow)

Use edge labels: `value="①"` with `fontSize=14;fontStyle=1;labelBackgroundColor=#ffffff;`

## Companion Guide

After generating the .drawio file, also generate a markdown guide:
- Same filename with `.md` extension
- Contents: diagram title, flow description (numbered steps), service list with purpose, key design decisions

## Two-Step Edit Approach
After generating the initial .drawio file:
1. **Export to PNG** using the draw.io CLI (see Export section)
2. **Review the PNG** visually — check for empty/broken icons, overlapping edges, misaligned labels
3. **Fix issues** in the .drawio XML and re-export

This catches rendering problems (wrong stencil names, broken styles) that are invisible in raw XML.

## Icon Name Gotchas — CRITICAL
draw.io stencil names do NOT always match current AWS service names. Services that were renamed keep their legacy stencil names:

| AWS Service Name | draw.io resIcon name | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Amazon OpenSearch Service | `elasticsearch_service` | Renamed from Elasticsearch in 2021; `opensearch_service` also works |
| Amazon EventBridge | `eventbridge` | Was CloudWatch Events |
| AWS Fargate | `fargate` | Correct |
| VPC Peering | `peering` | Resource-level: `shape=mxgraph.aws4.peering;strokeColor=none` — NOT `vpc_peering` or `peering_connection` (those render as blank squares) |
| Amazon MSK | `managed_streaming_for_kafka` | NOT `msk` (renders as blank square) |
| IAM Identity Center | `single_sign_on` | NOT `iam_identity_center` (renders as blank square) |

**Rule:** Always verify icon names from the reference files. If a service icon renders as an empty box, the stencil name is wrong. Check the draw.io source at `src/main/webapp/js/diagramly/sidebar/Sidebar-AWS4.js` for the canonical name (or `Sidebar-AWS3D.js` for the legacy 3D/isometric library, or `Sidebar-AlliedTelesis.js` for the generic hardware image library — note the 3D library's shape names are camelCase, e.g. `dynamoDb` not `dynamodb`).

**Fallback for unmapped services:** If a service is NOT found in any reference file, use this generic AWS cloud icon with the service name as label:
```
sketch=0;outlineConnect=0;fontColor=#232F3E;fillColor=#232F3E;strokeColor=#ffffff;dashed=0;verticalLabelPosition=bottom;verticalAlign=top;align=center;html=1;fontSize=12;fontStyle=0;aspect=fixed;shape=mxgraph.aws4.resourceIcon;resIcon=mxgraph.aws4.general_AWScloud
```
Never render an unknown service as a plain colored rectangle with no label.

## Validation Step

After generating XML, verify:
1. Every `resIcon=` value exists in the reference files
2. Service-level icons have `strokeColor=#ffffff`
3. Resource-level icons have `strokeColor=none`
4. No XML comments present
5. All cell IDs are unique
6. Every edge has `<mxGeometry relative="1" as="geometry" />`
7. No icon uses a guessed stencil name — all verified against reference files
8. Every edge has both `source` and `target` attributes referencing valid cell IDs (no floating edges)
9. All group/boundary shapes include `container=1;dropTarget=1;` in their style
10. Children inside boundaries use `parent="<boundary-id>"` (not `parent="1"`)

## Export

For PNG/SVG/PDF export using draw.io Desktop CLI:

### Multi-page Diagrams
For complex architectures, use multiple pages in one .drawio file:
```xml
<mxfile>
  <diagram id="overview" name="Overview">...</diagram>
  <diagram id="networking" name="Networking Detail">...</diagram>
  <diagram id="data-flow" name="Data Flow">...</diagram>
</mxfile>
```
- Page 1: High-level overview (service-level icons only)
- Page 2+: Detail views (resource-level icons, subnet layouts, etc.)

### Legend / Title Block
Place in top-left corner, inside the background rectangle:
```xml
<mxCell value="&lt;b&gt;Diagram Title&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author | Date | Version" style="text;html=1;align=left;verticalAlign=top;whiteSpace=wrap;rounded=0;fontSize=14;spacing=8;" vertex="1" parent="1">
  <mxGeometry x="40" y="40" width="300" height="50" as="geometry" />
</mxCell>
```

### PNG Export Background Fix
Place a `#F5F5F5` rectangle covering the entire diagram as the bottom-most element to prevent black background on export.

### Export CLI

| Platform | CLI Path |
|----------|----------|
| macOS | `/Applications/draw.io.app/Contents/MacOS/draw.io` |
| Linux | `drawio` (on PATH via snap/apt) |
| Windows | `"C:\Program Files\draw.io\draw.io.exe"` |

```bash
<CLI> -x -f <format> -e -b 10 -o <output> <input>
```

Flags: `-x` export, `-f` format (png/svg/pdf), `-e` embed diagram XML, `-b 10` border

Exported files use double extension: `name.drawio.png` — signals embedded XML, re-editable in draw.io.

## XML Well-formedness (CRITICAL)

- **NEVER include XML comments (`<!-- -->`)** — they cause parse errors
- Escape special characters: `&amp;` `&lt;` `&gt;` `&quot;`
- Always use unique `id` values for each mxCell
- Every edge MUST have `<mxGeometry relative="1" as="geometry" />` as child
- Root structure requires cells `id="0"` (root) and `id="1"` (default layer, parent="0")
